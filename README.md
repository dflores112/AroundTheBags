Using any programming language you'd like, build a solution to provide the subtotal, taxes, and total for a specific order given an order id accounting for the quantities of each item in the order and the taxes associated with the city of the customer.

Your solution should produce output that includes the following information for order sfg47:

Order: sfg47
Customer Name: Johnny Cueto
Subtotal: 9.98
Taxes: 0.72
Total: 10.70

We need to be able to provide an order_id as input (CLI argument, URL param, web form, etc.) and expect to display the output of your code.

The output of your solution does not need to match the above formatting. It can be from stdout, and maybe produces json, or rendered html in a webpage, or anything else as long as the output can be seen and checked for correctness.
